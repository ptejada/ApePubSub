 * Instead of editing the Class files directly you may make
 * the changes in this space before calling the ->start() method.
 * For example: if we want to change the default Username from "Guess"
 * to "Stranger" you do this:
 *
 * $user->config->userDefaultData->Username = 'Stranger';
 *
 * You may change and customize all the options and configurations like
 * this, even the error messages. By exporting your customizations outside
 * the class file it will be easier to maintain your application configuration
 * and update the class core itself in the future.
